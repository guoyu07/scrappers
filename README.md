# scrappers

Some random crawlers I use to collect random data.

- [`afamily`](https://github.com/lebinh/scrappers/blob/master/scrappers/spiders/afamily.py), [`kenh14`](https://github.com/lebinh/scrappers/blob/master/scrappers/spiders/kenh14.py), [`loicaviet`](https://github.com/lebinh/scrappers/blob/master/scrappers/spiders/loicaviet.py), [`vnexpress`](https://github.com/lebinh/scrappers/blob/master/scrappers/spiders/vnexpress.py) are used in to collect Vietnamese text for training the deep learning model in [vietnamese-accent-model](https://github.com/lebinh/vietnamese-accent-model).
